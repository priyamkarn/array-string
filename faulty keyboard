Geek has a unique keyboard containing only the numpad keys. ie - 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. But the keyboard is damaged and can only process M keys. 
Geek is supposed to use the keyboard to type as many natural numbers as possible starting from 1. 
What will be the greatest natural number he will type?  

int solve(int M)
{
    int c=0;
    while(M>0)
    {
        M=M/10;
        c++;
    }
    return c;
}
    int maxNatural(int M){
        // code here
        int ans=0;
        int p=1;
        while(M>0)
        {
            int countdigit = solve(p);
        if (M >= countdigit) {
            M = M - countdigit;
            p++;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    return p - 1;
    }
